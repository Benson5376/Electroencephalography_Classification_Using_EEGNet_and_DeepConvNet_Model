# Electroencephalography_Classification_Using_EEGNet_and_DeepConvNet_Model
This project implements EEG classification models, specifically EEGNet and DeepConvNet, using the BCI Competition III dataset. It explores the impact of different activation functions (ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and ELU) on model performance. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying motor imagery EEG signals.
